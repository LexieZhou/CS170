    "After running the q4 tests and looking at the generated graph, you should see that the naive solver is faster than the ILP reduction for small examples but the ILP reduction is faster for large examples. This highlights some of the tradeoffs between the two approaches: the ILP solver is more efficient for larger examples, but calling the solver incurs additional overhead, making it slower for small cases. On the flip side, the naive solver introduces relatively little additional overhead, but performs poorly on larger problems."
